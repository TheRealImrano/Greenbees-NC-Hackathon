        <h1>The Rules</h1>
        <p>You're a busy worker bee who wants to make a positive impact on the environment. You've noticed that your hive's honey-making practices could be more eco-friendly, so you want to convince your queen to go green. However, you know you can't just ask for an audience - you have to go through the proper chain of command, one honeycomb at a time.</p>
        <p>Bees hate conflict. When two interacting neighbours currently have the same colour, everything is fine; however, if they have different colours, then <i>both</i> will change to the third available option as a compromise.</p>
        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>This little game was submitted as a contribution to Northcoders' first (annual..?) hackathon. As such, it is the product of only 48h hours of planning and coding and definitely not where we'd like it to be, but we're leaving it here "as is". If you're liking our work, please check out our other projects on our gitHub pages! :)</p>
